Using this grading script:

1) Dump the list of your students into students.txt
    (Case ID, one per line)

2) Download the entire gradebook's files for one assignment
    into a folder like HW3/

    (so that the file HW3/gradebook_fall_2011_HW 3.zip exists)

3) sh prepare.sh HW3 students.txt

4) Open up the HW3 directory in MATLAB and step through the subdirectories.
